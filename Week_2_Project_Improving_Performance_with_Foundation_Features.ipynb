        "# Week 2: Leveraging Foundation Models for Robust Supervised Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "In last week's project, you saw how important choosing the right features is to creating a successful ML model. For more complex modalities like language, speech, and vision, we didn't use the best features we could have! In the week 1 reference notebook, we used standard baseline feature encodings for these modalities. In this project we will use *foundation model features*. These models can be trained on large, related datasets and from them we can extract general features for prediction tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we will introduce several Kaggle challenge datasets for further improvement via foundation models! The project notebook will introduce a few different foundation models to use as features, and establish a basic baseline system with each. You can leverage these models along with anything else you explored in Week 1 with the continued goal of using build-measure-learn iterations to achieve the best system you can.\n",
        "\n",
        "Foundation models are often complex deep learning models with large datasets and many parameters. We provide pre-trained foundation models for use in this project. If you want to learn more about designing and training foundation models, check out the Uplimit introduction to deep learning course!\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: foundation models apply to modalities like language, speech, and vision, but they generally aren't used for featurizing tabular data. If you would like to continue working on tabular data, you are welcome to work on Dataset 1 (the transaction fraud dataset). Otherwise, you can try foundation models on one of the other datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We provide starter code below as a scaffold. You will be using many of the skills you learned from previous weeks to complete this notebook.\n",
        "2. Ensure you read through the document and starting code before beginning your work. Understand the overall structure and goals of the project to make your iteration smoother.\n",
        "3. As in Week 1, keep track of what you try and iterate towards building the best ML system you can! You are also welcome to try some targeted evaluations of your model to see if e.g. foundation features make the model more robust to noisy or transformed inputs."

        "Word2Vec is a very popular algorithm to map individual words to high dimensional vector representations. It does so in a way that synonymous words will be close to each other in vector space. In fact, a famous example for Word2Vec is that embedding of `king` - embedding of `man` + embedding of `woman` returns the embedding of `queen`. This example illustrates that these representations hold semantic meaning.\n",

        "Word2Vec is trained on a large text corpus, from Twitter to a collection of books. The training distribution has a large effect on the representations learned! The advantage of Word2Vec is simplicity: the model is stored as a large dictionary from words to embeddings. Additionally, it captures more complex behavior than TF-IDF (which we saw from week 1). The downside is still its assumption on word independence. We know as language speakers that words are rarely used in isolation. As such, the perfect representation should capture the context a word is used in; Word2Vec sacrifices this. In practice, Word2Vec returns an embedding for every word in the sentence but we average across all words in a sentence to achieve a single embedding per tweet."
